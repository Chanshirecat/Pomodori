## Overview
Pomodori is an app designed to help users study more efficiently using the Pomodoro technique. It splits learning time into intervals of focused work and breaks, allowing users to maintain motivation and track their progress.

Users can:
- Save learning sessions with a name and description
- Track overall learning progress
- Personalize sessions with icons for different types of activities (e.g., coding, vocabulary)
- Interact with a friendly mascot to enhance engagement

The app is designed in calming, desaturated earthy colors to support focus and reduce distractions.

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer:** Set intervals for learning and breaks
- **Session Tracking:** Save sessions with names, descriptions, and optional icons
- **User Progress Overview:** Review previous sessions to see learning achievements
- **Personalization:** Change session details, and in future versions, customize icons, colors, animations, and affirmations

## Development
Challenges during development included:
- Implementing the timer and managing fragments in Android
- Handling the database operations for session storage
- Integrating the prototype design into a working app

All challenges were resolved via research, online resources, and guidance from instructors.

## User Testing & Evaluation
- Conducted SEQ (Single Ease Question) tests and interviews with participants aged 20â€“33
- Evaluated usability, motivation, and personalization options
- Adjusted design based on heuristic evaluation (Nielsen principles)
- Prototype and final app both received positive feedback for usability, calming design, and session tracking

## Future Improvements
- Allow users to select custom icons for sessions
- Enable full interface personalization (colors, pause animations, affirmation messages)
- Automatically save sessions at the end of a Pomodoro interval
